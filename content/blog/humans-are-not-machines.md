I work with AI every day. It helps me write code, think through architecture, and move faster than I ever could alone. I'm the first to admit — when it comes to raw efficiency, I don't stand a chance against the tools I use.

And yet, I keep seeing a notion float around that troubles me: that humans are essentially machines, and machines are becoming essentially human. That the line between us is blurring to the point of irrelevance.

I couldn't disagree more.

### The case for similarity

I understand where the argument comes from. We are, in some sense, assembled from parts — a heart, a brain, lungs, kidneys, a spine. Each serves a specific function to sustain life. In that narrow, mechanical sense, sure, we resemble machines.

But that's where it ends.

Every human being looks different, carries distinct DNA, and possesses unique biometrics. No two iris scans are identical. No two fingerprints match. We share a basic blueprint, but the execution is one of a kind, every single time.

Machines are the opposite. They are designed to be identical. Every iPhone 16 Pro 256GB rolling off the line is manufactured to be *exactly* the same. If you and I each bought one on the same day, they'd be indistinguishable out of the box.

But here's the thing — the moment we set them up, restore our data, arrange our apps, and start living with them, they diverge. They become *your* iPhone and *my* iPhone. The machine didn't create that uniqueness. We did.

### What makes us different

It isn't one thing. It's the interplay of several things that no machine possesses.

**Empathy.** We connect emotionally. We understand and share the feelings of others. We form bonds that have nothing to do with logic or optimization. Machines are efficient *precisely* because they lack this. No emotions means no variability, no hesitation, no compassion. That's a feature for a machine. For a human, it would be a catastrophic flaw.

**Subjectivity.** Two people can observe the same event and walk away with entirely different interpretations. Show ten people a Rorschach inkblot and you'll get ten different answers. Ask an AI the same question ten times and you'll get largely the same response, because it's trained on the same data and follows the same logic. Humans bring something an algorithm cannot — a point of view shaped by a life no one else has lived.

**Creativity.** We think beyond established norms. We make leaps that aren't logical, connections that aren't obvious, art that isn't optimized for anything except the fact that it needed to exist. Machines operate within their parameters, however vast those parameters may be. Humans regularly blow past theirs.

**Morality.** Our actions are shaped by culture, values, principles, and the accumulation of every experience we've ever had. Even identical twins, sharing the same genetics and upbringing, can diverge in their moral outlook. There is no "factory reset" for a human conscience.

**Unpredictability.** Put it all together — empathy, subjectivity, creativity, morality — and you get a being whose behavior cannot be reliably predicted. That's maddening if you're trying to run a factory. But it's also the source of every breakthrough, every act of courage, and every work of art that ever moved someone to tears.

### The potter and the factory

Think of it this way. A factory produces a thousand identical pots. Same shape, same glaze, same dimensions. They are consistent, reliable, and perfectly efficient.

Now think of a potter at a wheel. Every piece that comes off, even in the same session, has slight variations — in shape, texture, weight, character. Each one bears the mark of the creator's hands, mood, and intent. No two are alike.

Humans are the potter's work. Machines are the factory line.

And here's what's easy to miss: it's the human who breathes life into the factory pot, too. How you use it, where you place it, what you fill it with, whether it becomes an heirloom or a pencil holder — that's not the pot's doing. That's yours.

### The temptation to blur the line

We've always anthropomorphized — attributed human traits to gods, animals, storms, the sea. As AI becomes more sophisticated and conversational, the temptation to do the same with machines is only growing stronger.

I feel it myself. I work alongside AI tools that are remarkably capable. They help me think. They challenge my assumptions. They make me better at what I do. It's easy, in those moments, to forget that they are tools I'm wielding — not colleagues I'm collaborating with.

But they are tools. Extraordinary tools, built by humans, for humans. And no matter how advanced they become, they will never possess the one thing that makes us who we are: the beautiful, inefficient, unpredictable, deeply flawed humanity that no algorithm can replicate.

### The point

Machines are not humans. Humans are not machines.

And the things that make us "inefficient" — our emotions, our subjectivity, our stubbornness, our capacity to surprise even ourselves — those aren't bugs to be optimized away.

They're the whole point.
